# VINS-Mono-Preprocessor
- A data preprocessing system based on VINS-Mono which can output timestamp aligned images and IMU data.

- This folder contains two versions, ROS1 and ROS2. The ROS2 version is more convenient and easy to use (including one click start function and simplification of topics, etc) , so it is more recommended for your use.

- Due to the increasingly widespread use of ROS2, this system focuses on streamlining the ROS2 version and improving its usability. The initial principles and unpackaged usage methods are detailed in the ROS1 version.
